# Quick Task 003: Swap Phase 16 and 17 — Summary

## What Changed
Swapped Phase 16 and Phase 17 in ROADMAP.md and STATE.md:

- **Phase 16** is now: Transaction UI (Simple Accounts)
- **Phase 17** is now: Error Handling Patterns

## Files Modified
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — Summary list, detailed sections, progress table
- `.planning/STATE.md` — Next action reference, milestone reference

## Dependency Chain
- Phase 15 (API Integration Validation) → Phase 16 (Transaction UI) → Phase 17 (Error Handling) → Phase 18 (Split Transactions UI)

No other phases affected — the linear dependency chain is preserved.
