# Phase 4.2: Current User Metadata Endpoint - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add a `/auth/me` endpoint that returns the authenticated user's profile metadata. This is a read-only endpoint for the currently authenticated user. User profile editing and household management are separate phases.

</domain>

## Implementation Decisions

### Response shape
- Nested household object, not just household_id
- Household includes: id, name, is_owner flag
- No account-related metadata (accounts fetched separately)
- User fields: user_id, email, display_name, email_verified

### Display name
- Add display_name column to users table (nullable)
- Stored field, not derived from email
- User can set it later via profile settings (future phase)

### Household name
- Add name column to households table (nullable with default)
- Default value: "My Household"
- User can change it later via settings (future phase)
- Set at household creation with default, not during registration

### Claude's Discretion
- Whether to include timestamps (created_at, last_login)
- Exact field naming (follow existing API patterns)
- Error response format (match other protected endpoints)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Response should be useful for frontend dashboard/header showing "Welcome, [display_name]" and household context
- is_owner flag in household object prepares for Phase 25 (Multi-User Households) without requiring additional API calls

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
