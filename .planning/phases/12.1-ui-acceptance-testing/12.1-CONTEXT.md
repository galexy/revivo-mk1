# Phase 12.1: UI Acceptance Testing Framework - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Origin:** Split from Phase 12 (Frontend Infrastructure)

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish the Claude Code Chrome-driven acceptance testing framework. This phase sets up the conventions, directory structure, and initial smoke test so all subsequent UI phases (13+) can write repeatable acceptance test scenarios as they build features. No UI features are built — just the testing framework.

## Implementation Decisions

### Acceptance Test Framework
- Acceptance tests are persistent, repeatable test scenarios — not ad-hoc verification
- Test scenarios written as markdown files in `apps/web/tests/acceptance/`
- Natural language test steps that Claude Code reads and executes via Chrome integration (`claude --chrome`)
- Tests run against real API (both API and web servers must be running)
- NOT Playwright scripts — Claude Code drives the browser via Chrome DevTools integration
- Build a repository of these test scenarios incrementally as UI features are added
- Acceptance tests should be continuously runnable (like integration tests), not just at verify stage

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact markdown format for test scenarios
- Directory organization within tests/acceptance/
- How to document the workflow in CLAUDE.md

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Claude Code Chrome integration docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome
- Test scenarios should follow a consistent format: Given/When/Then or numbered steps
- Include a template file that future phases copy when writing new acceptance tests
- CLAUDE.md should document: how to run acceptance tests, how to write new ones, prerequisites (servers running)

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Claude Code GSD skills for browser-driven UAT automation — future, start with manual test scenarios first
- CI integration for acceptance tests — these are developer/Claude-driven, not CI-driven
- Visual regression testing — separate concern

</deferred>
